    <h1>Fleet & Driver Management System</h1>
    <p>
        An administrative platform for managing fleets, drivers,
        vehicle documents, quotas, and subsidy program eligibility
        with role-based access and audit-ready workflows.
    </p>

<CaseStudySection Title="Problem">
    Managing fleets and drivers across multiple programs was fragmented
    and manual. Vehicle documents, driver eligibility, quota limits,
    and subsidy rules were tracked inconsistently, increasing the risk
    of compliance issues and operational errors.
</CaseStudySection>

<CaseStudySection Title="Constraints">
    <ul>
        <li>Strict subsidy program eligibility rules</li>
        <li>Vehicle and driver data must be auditable</li>
        <li>Document uploads required secure storage</li>
        <li>Different access levels for admin and normal users</li>
    </ul>
</CaseStudySection>

<CaseStudySection Title="Solution">
    Built a centralized fleet and driver management system
    with role-based access, document upload handling,
    quota enforcement logic, and real-time validation
    of subsidy program eligibility.
</CaseStudySection>

<CaseStudyArchitecture
    Description="
        The system uses Blazor Server for secure administrative interfaces,
        JavaScript interop for dynamic UI behavior,
        Azure Blob Storage for document management,
        and SQL Server to enforce data integrity, quotas,
        and program eligibility rules.
    " />

<CaseStudyOutcomes Items="Outcomes" />

<CaseStudySection Title="Key Technical Decisions">
    <ul>
        <li>Role-based UI rendering for admin vs non-admin users</li>
        <li>Quota validation enforced before submission</li>
        <li>Blob storage for document uploads to avoid DB bloat</li>
        <li>JavaScript interop for file upload and dynamic UI control</li>
    </ul>
</CaseStudySection>

<CaseStudySection Title="What I’d Improve Next">
    Add automated document expiry alerts,
    implement bulk driver import,
    and introduce dashboard views for fleet utilization trends.
