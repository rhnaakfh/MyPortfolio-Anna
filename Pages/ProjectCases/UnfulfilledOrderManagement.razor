    <h1>Exception & Unfulfilled Order Management System</h1>
    <p>
        A role-based exception handling platform for managing
        unfulfilled purchase orders, approvals, bulk imports,
        and evidence attachments with strict business rule enforcement.
    </p>

    <CaseStudyTechStack Items="TechStack" />
</Header>

<CaseStudySection Title="Problem">
    Unfulfilled purchase orders were previously handled through
    manual communication and spreadsheets, resulting in
    inconsistent decision-making, missing evidence,
    and limited audit visibility for operational and finance teams.
</CaseStudySection>

<CaseStudySection Title="Constraints">
    <ul>
        <li>Different portals for supplier and warehouse users</li>
        <li>Business rules vary by unfulfilled reason type</li>
        <li>Attachments may be mandatory, optional, or disallowed</li>
        <li>Bulk processing required for high-volume scenarios</li>
    </ul>
</CaseStudySection>

<CaseStudySection Title="Solution">
    Built a structured exception management workflow with
    role-based visibility, configurable business rules,
    bulk CSV import support, approval handling,
    and secure attachment uploads backed by cloud storage.
</CaseStudySection>

<CaseStudyArchitecture
    Description="
        The system separates supplier and warehouse workflows
        at the UI level while enforcing business rules centrally.
        Blazor Server manages dynamic form rendering,
        SQL Server stored procedures validate rule compliance,
        and Azure Blob Storage securely stores supporting evidence.
    " />

<CaseStudyOutcomes Items="Outcomes" />

<CaseStudySection Title="Key Technical Decisions">
    <ul>
        <li>Rule-driven behavior controlled via database configuration</li>
        <li>Dynamic UI rendering based on unfulfilled reason metadata</li>
        <li>Bulk CSV import with row-level validation and error handling</li>
        <li>Base64 image processing with blob storage integration</li>
    </ul>
</CaseStudySection>

<CaseStudySection Title="What I’d Improve Next">
    Add configurable SLA timers for approvals,
    introduce notification escalation rules,
    and provide analytics dashboards for unfulfilled trends
    by supplier, warehouse, and reason type.
